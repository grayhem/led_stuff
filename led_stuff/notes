getting ready to try my RGB quaternion slerp idea. downloaded new transformations.py from gohlke.
it has a slerp command now. very convenient.
set up a git repository for the project. 
spent some time messing with python process control... not worth the effort. just remember
to launch fadecandy server with
sudo nohup ~/fadecandy/server/fcserver & 
and then safely forget about it.
